The virtual experience programme is provided by Tata iQ or Tata Insights and Quants. I discover how passionate, multidisciplinary experts utilise data visualisation technologies like Tableau and Power BI to take on some of the most difficult business problems and uncover fascinating insights buried in the mountains of produced data. 

The programme demonstrates the kind of issues dealt with by Tata Insights and Quants every day and makes an effort to imitate the difficulties an individual could have.

## **There are 4 modules in this virtual experience programme.**

**♦ Framing the Business Scenario**

**♦ Choosing the Right Visuals**

**♦ Creating Effective Visuals**

**♦ Communicating Insights and Analysis**

## **Task 1 - Framing the Business Scenario**
Learn how to anticipate the questions our business leaders will need answers to.

**Background info and context**

An online retail store has hired us as a consultant to review their data and provide insights that would be valuable to the CEO and CMO of the business. The business has been performing well and the management wants to analyse what the major contributing factors are to the revenue so they can strategically plan for next year.

The leadership is interested in viewing the metrics from both an operations and marketing perspective. Management also intends to expand the business and is interested in seeking guidance into areas that are performing well so they can keep a clear focus on what’s working. They would also like to view different metrics based on the demographic information that is available in the data.

A meeting with the CEO and CMO has been scheduled for next month and we need to draft the relevant analytics and insights that would help evaluate the current business performance and suggest metrics that would enable them to make the decision on expansion.

Remember, thinking from the perspective of business leaders allows us to analyse the data more effectively and present better insights.

Access the links in the resources below to better understand how business leaders think and approach business performance.

**Details for task**

To prepare for our meeting, we need to draft questions that we think will be important and relevant to the CEO and CMO. This preparation will be our guide as we develop our presentation.

For this task, we are only required to draft the questions. Make sure to think both quantitatively and qualitatively.

We’ve been provided a dataset in the resources below to use as the basis for our exploration. Review this data, taking note of what information has been provided, what insights we can garner, and what is relevant to both the CEO and CMO respectively.

Create a set of four questions that we anticipate each business leader will ask and want to know the answers to. Make sure we differentiate our questions, as both the CEO and CMO view business decisions through different lenses.

Eight (8) questions in total (4 for the CEO and 4 for the CMO)

## **Task 2 - Choosing the Right Visuals**
Learn which visuals are most effective in a given scenario

**Background info and context**

We have been asked by the CEO and CMO to provide visuals on the metrics that they wish to analyse for the online retail store. We will gather the requirements and provide them with the type of visual that would be best suited to the scenario. The senior management wants to understand how their business is performing and what areas are the key strengths of the company. They are also focused on identifying opportunities that would lead to growth and generate more revenue in the future.

We will be provided multiple visualisation requests by the CEO and we would need to provide the visual which would explain the data and insights in the simplest possible manner. The visual should adequately convey the information that we are trying to present. This exercise is critical to the senior management as any incorrect representation can lead to a wrong message being conveyed, or a wrong decision taken by the management. Therefore, we would need to make sure that the correct visuals are used to represent each set of data.

**Details for task**

In this task, we will be required to read the questions carefully and understand that business requirement. Once we have an idea of what is required from the perspective of the CEO and CMO, we will need to come up with the perfect visual which will illustrate what the senior managers are looking for in each scenario. Remember, data can be presented in multiple types of charts, but we are required to select the visual that would best display the information which is being presented.

We will be provided resources on how to select visuals based on the different scenarios, these are available in the resources section. These resources will help we get an idea on which visual to select for the given business scenario and will also guide we on how to choose the right chart or graph for our data. Each question will contain a unique scenario and we will be expected to answer the questions based on that scenario.

To complete this task, answer the multiple-choice quiz. Start the quiz by clicking 'Click here to start the task' in section 5 below. Please note there are 5 multiple choice questions to complete in this task. Please be patient as each question loads.

## **Task 3 - Creating Effective Visuals**
Apply our under and create visuals based on business scenarios

**Background info and context**

The CEO and CMO have recently met to finalise the requirements and would like us to provide them with some analysis and visuals that would help answer their questions. Both, the executives are interested in viewing and understanding how they can use the data to make more meaningful decisions. We would need to provide insights which they can use to create the expansion strategy. The executives want to analyse the trends and the breakdown by different categories so that they have clarity on how the revenue is being generated and what are the main factors affecting the online store.

We will be provided with the requirements of the executives and how they want to view the data. After the requirement gathering phase, we would need to make sure that the data we are using is of good quality and does not contain any bad data that would have an adverse impact on our analysis. Once the data is cleaned, the next step would be to create the visuals on either Tableau or Power BI. No matter which tool we choose for the visuals, the result should be the same. These results will help the executives with effective decision making and assist in their expansion strategy.

**Details for task**

In this task, we will create the visuals around four of the questions that the CEO and CMO have requested. We can use either Tableau or Power BI to create the visuals and we’ve provided the data in the resources below. 
Both Power BI and Tableau have free trials that can be accessed in order to complete this task. We can find a resource below that directs us how to download these free trials.

**Data cleanup**

Before we can begin the analysis, make sure that the data is cleaned properly. We have noticed that the data contains some returns to the store which are provided in negative quantities and there are unit prices which were input in error. We will need to perform the following steps to clean this data.

• Create a check that the quantity should not be below 1 unit

• Create a check that the Unit price should not be below $0

Please note that in order to apply the checks that have been mentioned above, we would need to use conditional formulas where the logic would state that if the conditions are met then the tool should exclude the data from analysis. We can also use data transformation methods to get rid of the bad data. Both these methods are provided in the resources section. Once this is done, the data will be good to be used for further analysis. Please note that this data should be cleaned up before attempting any question.

Create each visual on a separate tab with the name of the tab displaying the question number. Once the visuals are created, save the files and upload them below. 
For Tableau users, we would need to upload in .twbx format whereas Power BI files need to be saved in .pbix format. 
Instructions on how to save in these formats are provided in the resources section.

**Should we get stuck, please reference the Visuals Hints document in the resources.**

**Question 1**

The CEO of the retail store is interested to view the time series of the revenue data for the year 2011 only. He would like to view granular data by looking into revenue for each month. The CEO is interested in viewing the seasonal trends and wants to dig deeper into why these trends occur. This analysis will be helpful for the CEO to forecast for the next year.

**Question 2**

The CMO is interested in viewing the top 10 countries which are generating the highest revenue. Additionally, the CMO is also interested in viewing the quantity sold along with the revenue generated. The CMO does not want to have the United Kingdom in this visual.

**Question 3**

The CMO of the online retail store wants to view the information on the top 10 customers by revenue. He is interested in a visual that shows the greatest revenue generating customer at the start and gradually declines to the lower revenue generating customers. The CMO wants to target the higher revenue generating customers and ensure that they remain satisfied with their products.

**Question 4**

The CEO is looking to gain insights on the demand for their products. He wants to look at all countries and see which regions have the greatest demand for their products. Once the CEO gets an idea of the regions that have high demand, he will initiate an expansion strategy which will allow the company to target these areas and generate more business from these regions. He wants to view the entire data on a single view without the need to scroll or hover over the data points to identify the demand. There is no need to show data for the United Kingdom as the CEO is more interested in viewing the countries that have expansion opportunities.

## **Task 4 - Communicating Insights and Analysis**
Effectively communicate our findings and explain how it relates to each scenario

**Background info and context**

It’s time to present our findings to the CEO and CMO. They are interested in our thought process and how we have handled the data cleanup and visualisation phase. It is important to explain our thought process and ideas in a clear and straightforward way. We are also required to clearly present the analysis of all four questions from the previous task. Make sure we are well versed with the data and the conclusions we’ve made from our analysis. 

Expansion is top of mind for these leaders and they’re keen to understand where the most lucrative opportunities are in their business.
